# 🚨 Real-Time Accident Detection & Alert System  
### AI-Based Web Application with Live CCTV Monitoring

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Accident Detection & Alert System** is an AI-based web application that monitors **live video streams** from CCTV cameras, RTSP feeds, or uploaded videos to detect road accidents in real time.

Using **computer vision and deep learning**, the system analyzes traffic behavior to identify abnormal events such as **vehicle collisions or sudden stops**. Once an accident is detected, the system captures evidence and generates instant alerts to improve emergency response time.

This project is designed to reduce dependency on manual accident reporting and enhance road safety through automation.
